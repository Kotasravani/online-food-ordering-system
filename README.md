The purpose of Online Food Ordering System is to automate the existing manual system by the help of computerized equipment’s and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. The required software and hardware are easily available and easy to work with.

Online Food Ordering System, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast management system. The organization can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. That means that one need not be distracted by information that is not relevant, while being able to reach the information. We can implement further with using this code.

Moving on, this food ordering system project in Python Django focuses mainly on dealing with managing food orders. Also, the system displays all the available food menus and carts. In addition, the system allows managing food items. This project is divided into two categories: User, and Admin Panel. In an overview of this web application, a user can simply register and start using it. Here, the system displays all the available food menus where the user can add them to the cart. The user has to select amongst the available food choices. Each section contains its own prices. After all, the user can check his/her cart, remove unwanted orders too. And finally, the user can checkout. After checkout, the user can view all the food orders under the Orders section. Here, the system marks delivered orders using green and remaining with red color.

On the other hand, the user can access the Django administrator panel by providing admin credentials. The Django administrator panel contains all the management sides of the system. It includes management of food menu, user, and orders. The administrator can simply add more food menus by providing details such as name, description, price, and GIF attachment to it. Similarly, the user can check the customer order section to list all the orders. Here, the admin can simply check on the delivered radio button to mark it as delivered. Or also, the admin can log in to the system and check the orders section to list out all the orders. It displays order date, order items, customer’s name with order status. The admin can simply click on the order list to mark it as delivered. Rest all the things can be under the Django admin panel.
